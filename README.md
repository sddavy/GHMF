About the fountain:
--------------------

The Grand Haven Musical Fountain in Grand Haven, MI, USA is an enchanting spectacle of water and lights that is creatively synchronized to a wide variety of well-known musical selections by a group of volunteer choreographers. Each scheduled 25-30 minute show is free has played on Dewey Hill nightly at dark from Memorial Day through Labor Day since 1962.

The Grand Haven Musical Fountain is a complex system, pairing pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical distribution, sound, music, and LED lighting to a computer & Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) via Ethernet to perform each one of its many shows.
In order to create shows on this complex system, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been created to simplify the process of programming it. However, despite many improvements over the years, the latest version (1.87) still lacks full control over certain aspects of the programming.

Engineer William Morris Booth designed the fountain, which was later built by volunteers for an estimated $50,000, with an annual budget of $40,000, despite work being done nearly entirely by unpaid volunteers. An ongoing partnership with Grand Valley University has provided the fountain with many improvements over the years; water features such as the "Helix" and "Wave" as senior projects for students, finding new partnerships including with Apex Controls for new visual programming software, and evem a new Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).

About this website:
-------------------

This website was created by a choreographer, Samuel Davy, to help explain and simplify some of the aspects of programming, particularly the backlighting control.

Future improvements:
-------------------

I plan to use this website to bring future improvements such as a 3-dimensional ultra-realistic simulation, online free-to-use version of the software with additional features, complete modern documentation, and more.

If you are interested in collaborating on this project, know of any useful tools, or have suggestions or even just ideas, please contact me at samuel.davy@icloud.com.
This is a large project to take on alone and I would appriciate any help I could get, esspecially since I and not a professional at coding.

Thank you :-)
