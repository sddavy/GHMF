        <p>
            The Grand Haven Musical Fountain is a complex system, pairing pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical distribution, sound, music, and LED lighting to a computer & Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) via Ethernet to perform each one of its many shows.

            In order to create shows on this complex system, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been created to simplify the process of programming it. However, despite many improvements over the years, the latest version (1.87) still lacks full control over certain aspects of the programming.

            This website was created by a choreographer, Samuel Davy, to help explain and simplify some of the aspects of programming, particularly the backlighting control.
