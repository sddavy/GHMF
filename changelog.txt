Update 7/17/25:
---------------

Changes:
Update .m3u8 stream on https://ghmfhelper.pages.dev/channelcam-advanced page
Move stream-url file to assets folder
Update channelcam-advanced.html to dynamically update stream url
Update stream-url.txt to use the current stream file
Update channelcam-simple.html to use normal imbed instead of .m3u8 stream

Description:
Created a text file to pull .m3u8 stream from instead of hardcoding it, which improves ease of maintaining website.
Fixed issues advanced channelcam not loading, by updating the stream-url.txt file to be the latest stream file I could find.
Removed the buggy hardcoded stream for the simple channelcam page, and replaced it with a normal IPcamlive imbed, which helps reliability, although it does currently display the WGHN ads.

Lots of clutter in the changelog, but mostly beta testing of different themes including dark and light mode. These changes were reverted after I determined that updating every page would be to time-consuming.
However, there was a lot of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) changes to make this site easier to find on Google searches.
