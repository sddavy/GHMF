Move stream-url file to assets folder
Update channelcam-advanced.html to dynamically update stream url
Update stream-url.txt to use the current stream file
Update channelcam-simple.html to use normal imbed instead of .m3u8 stream

Description:
Created a text file to pull .m3u8 stream from instead of hardcoding it, which improves ease of maintaining website.
Fixed issues advanced channelcam not loading, by updating the stream-url.txt file to be the latest stream file I could find.
Removed the buggy hardcoded stream for the simple channelcam page, and replaced it with a normal IPcamlive imbed, which helps reliability, although it does currently display the WGHN ads.
