When visiting the site for the first time, a notification pops up, and rather than hardcoding the message into all the files, I instead pull it from a welcome.txt file found in the /content folder. (Where this file is)
This makes it easier to update the website dynamically.

When visiting the site any other time, it displays another popup, which is pulled from the warning.txt file found in this folder as well. I can then just update the text file instead of every page on the webiste when I want users to get a notification.

Both popups have a "Never show me notifications again" checkbox, which when checked and the close button is pressed, saves a flag to local storage to never display notifications again.
